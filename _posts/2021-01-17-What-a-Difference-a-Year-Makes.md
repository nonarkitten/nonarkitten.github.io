title: What a difference a year makes...

I have to admit, I was getting close to full burnout, but the Yuletide break has managed to give me a little more energy than I had before and I've had a pretty productive couple of weeks.

The routing for Buffy is now done. I've lost track but I would guess that includin the couple of complete tearups, Ive spent a good 40 hours on this so far. As an amature and this being only my third electronics project, it feel like thats pretty good.

I still need to catch up on PJIT and sadly nothing has been done with that so far. For now, this will go onto review and Ill be plugging away on the firmware side in the meantime.
